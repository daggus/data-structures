## Dataveillance is the collection and sorting of data
Is is...
* descriptive (monitoring)
* predictive (conjecture)
* prescriptive (enactment)

The collection of data rationalized as 'enhanced user experience'
How to make people aware of the trade-off?
Once aware, would they choose the path that protects them most even if it means more 'work'?

**David Mitchell**
'Corpocracy'

_"To be usre, to participate in the project of modernity has arguably always meant that one becomes a calcuble subject by voluntarily surrendering data."_

Data collection is primarly about de-humanizing. It is about reducing the person into parsed data, which makes them easier to manipluate free of guilt and apprehension. 

To what degree will this reduce empathy over time?

Behaviorial scriptiong is unsettling when described and demonstrated in person. Dataveillance is the similar but unseen and even harder to recoginze.

It is unnecceary for any one company to have all information about a user when we are the sum of multiple pools of interconnected systesm that share data.

**Psychographics**
With just 10 likes, a computer model fundamentally knows you better than a colleague, according to additional research published by Kosinski in 2015. With 70 likes, it knows you better than a friend or roommate; with 150 likes, better than a family member. And with 300 likes, Big Data knows you better than your spouse.

# Countervailance
The use of blasting white noise or masking behavior in false threads of activity

_"...the capitalizion of almost everything."_
Andrew Leyshons and Nigel Thrift
