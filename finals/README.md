# AA
### Learning outcomes
This was good as an introduction to AWS, applied Javascript, data scraping, arrays and setting up the dev pipeline to create databases. It helped establish baseline vocabulary we would use throughout the class.

### Challenges
My lack of familiarity with Javascript and programming fundamentals was the single hardest thing about this assignment. This class, actually. It was a challenge not knowing Javascript then that was layered with assignments about designing UI and database structures without understanding the final shape of the assignment. I wasn't prepared for the amount of time I'd have to spend learning the skills that were required but not really taught. 

### Project notes

1. **Using Node.js (in Cloud 9), make a request for each of the ten "Meeting List Agenda" pages for Manhattan. Important: show the code for all ten requests.**

The key decision here was whether to loop and iterate on the request or simply make multiple requests. I did the later because there were only 10 files and I wanted the practice of typing and repeating an action. 

2. **Using Node.js: For each of the ten files you requested, save the body as a text file to your "local" environment (either on your own laptop or in AWS Cloud9).**

I had Zone 3. Use Cheerio to parse the data from the previous assignment into a list of addresses. Output this list into a text file. First involved use and practive of loops. 

3. **Study the HTML structure and tags and begin to think about how you might parse these files to extract relevant data for these AA meetings.**

4. **Update your GitHub repository with the relevant files: your js file and ten txt files. In Canvas, submit the URL of the specific location of this work within your data-structures GitHub repository.**



# Dear Diary
### Learning outcomes
Learning how to set up and manage a database and the differences between SQL and NoSQL. It was a surprise at the end of the assignment that we would also be doing some HTML and CSS. I wish that had been discussed in class so we could better prepare. The working vocabulary and high level concepts have been very useful in other classes and my freelence work. I enjoyed the personal aspect of this project, beign able to define our own ideas and test them. 

### Challenges
Not knowing much about databases, much of their set up felt arbitrary. I was mostly able to follow the instructions we were given but the underlying reasoning didn't always make sense. Just keeping up with the homwork was enough to occupy my time but I'd like/need to learn more about the connections between various setup decisions.

# Sensor
### Learning outcomes
I really enjoyed using the sensors. After so much work outputting data is was refreshing to work on something physical. It was helpful to connect the various stages for this project: the controller setup, the IDE for the controller, the data collection and the presentation. I'm very interested in the physicalization of data and this project helped to connect some dots. 

### Challenges
Having no previous experience with the sensors made it difficult to choose one at the beginning of the semester. It would've been helpful to see examples before making the selection. In general, I think more examples would have helped each assignment. Again, it wasn't clear how the actual data visualization would happen.
