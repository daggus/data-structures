<h1>Dear Diary,</h1>

<p>My diary was a response to images I documentated in daily life. These were mostly textures from New York City, Berlin and Paris. The project was inspired by a ritual for self reflection that was taught to me by a shaman. For that exercise the participant goes outdoors to find a rock that is roughly the size of their hand. Then, with a partner, the participant examines the rock and describes vocally any images they see in the surface texture. The excercise is about personal reflection and the participant is maeant to free associate about how the imgage make him/her feel and their potential meanings. During the process the partener takes notes of the participants personal reflections. </p>

It’s a reminder of the insane creativity of natural forces and the world's inherit ability to defy the human imagination. Every gem, every mineral is a work of art that challenges my concept of what the natural world can produce and I end up viewing the world with a renewed sense of wonder. This piece, a cross section, of a large mineral seems to openly reference and challenge the aesthetic of Van Gogh. Oh, you think he was a master? Well look at this. It’s also a reminder that I need to spend more time in nature - for my emotional well-being and creative inspiration."},"image":{"S":"image"},"video":{"S":"video"},"audio":{"S":"audio"}},{"dt":{"S":"Fri Nov 16 2018"},"time":{"S":"1:30pm"},"text":{"S":"In the middle of this image two pieces connect, the left half looks like a face in profile facing left, and the right side looks like a native american headdress. This is reinforced by the autumnal colors and the recent Thanksgiving holiday, which is basically a celebration of the organized appropriation and destruction of native american people and their culture. Growing up I was told that I was 1/16 Shawnee and that I might even qualify for native american scholarships in college. I never pursued these, thought, because it wasn’t my identity and I believed that money should be in the hands of someone who truly identified as native american. Flash forward many years and DNA testing has become a fashionable/achievable service. Turns out I don’t have any native american heritage. It’s not that it disappeared over generations. It just might never have existed in my family history. As a country we’ve done our best to erase entire groups of indigenous people and yet individuals still find some identity cache in association with those communities. Is that the product of some evolved state of mind? Residual, generational, guilt? An identification with the underdog?"},"image":{"S":"image"},"video":{"S":"video"},"audio":{"S":"audio"}},{"dt":{"S":"Fri Oct 12 2018"},"time":{"S":"1:30pm"},"text":{"S":"text"},"image":{"S":"image"},"video":{"S":"video"},"audio":{"S":"audio"}},{"dt":{"S":"Mon Oct 29 2018"},"time":{"S":"8:30am"},"text":{"S":"Maybe I’m influenced by Halloween but the first thing I saw in this image was a skull. It was a quick impression and the more I started the less apparent it became. Like a ghost that occupies the space of your peripheral vision but disappears when you try to look at it directly. My mother has been having a difficult time breathing and this past summer her doctors suggested the cause might be the migration of her rheumatoid arthritis to her lungs. Apparently both the lungs and heart can be affected in rare cases. She did some online research and read an article suggesting someone in her condition might have two years to live. This floored me. For more than 25 years my mom has dealt with more health issues than I could count and yet she keeps moving ahead, undeterred in her faith and will to live. Hearing a self-identified expiration date rocked me and I realized how much strength I draw from her love and will to survive. The skull represents represents the spectre of death, known or unprovoked, and is a reminder to live well because we don’t know when our time will come. I read somewhere that death should be reflected upon every day and only by confronting its reality can we come to terms with its imminence and manage the irrationality of our fears. For most of us, the world will get along fine when we’re gone."},"image":{"S":"image"},"video":{"S":"video"},"audio":{"S":"https://open.spotify.com/track/0aXUcEXBdHrekqfitXsN4U?si=PCdXm8ZDQyKips57n6o_MA"}},{"dt":{"S":"Sat Nov 17 2018"},"time":{"S":"1:30pm"},"text":{"S":"I see Rorschach, ink-blot tests. Which is, in many ways, what this project is all about: seeing objects in other objects or textures and surfacing reactions. I love this idea of using the world as a mirror, engaging the world in a dialog and actively looking for answers from deep within myself. Life is so busy, so kinetic, that I often don’t take the time for self reflection, and this practice is helping me touch base with my reflections, not just my reactions."},"image":{"S":"image"},"video":{"S":"video"},"audio":{"S":"audio"}},{"dt":{"S":"Sun Nov 18 2018"},"time":{"S":"1:30pm"},"text":{"S":"These look like cosmic energy. A kaleidoscopic nebula of butterflies. I haven’t been practicing my morning meditation and this is a reminder to re-introduce that into my morning routine. After taking ayahuasca it was relatively easy to slip into other realms but so much time has gone by that disengaging from the middle realm has become progressively more difficult. DMT sent me quickly, and deeply, back into that world but the connection was fleeting and didn’t have the lasting effect of ayahuasca. Perhaps it's time for another trip."},"image":{"S":"image"},"video":{"S":"video"},"audio":{"S":"audio"}},{"dt":{"S":"Thu Nov 01 2018"},"time":{"S":"7:30am"},"text":{"S":"It took a few seconds of softening my gaze but eventually the outline of a pair of underwear briefs emerged from this blizzard of splotches.

Which makes me realize many of these posts are about food and my relationship to meat and the the natural world. Clearly there’s something brewing in my subconscious about health and food. Also this recurring theme of connecting back to nature. I love NYC but I think it’s time to consider another destination to call home, some place with ample green, open skies and space to wander with the soft earth under my feet. Even writing this awaken a slumbering need for nature that I’ve repressed over the years. Yes. It’s time.

Revulsion and fascination in equal parts. What brave soul was the first to eat this? And why do this elicit that reaction but a I have an easier time looking at a cow and thinking ‘food’? Why is this creature more alien than a dog? It’s probably smarter than most dogs. I know it’s all solicatization and indoctrination but damn if that isn’t a real thing that needs to be be questioned. Constantly doubted and put under a microscope. This is so...shiny. And soft. And slick. I wonder what percentage of people think, even fleetingly, about putting their finger in that delicate, blue, hole? I’ve flirted with vegetarianism in the past and lately I’ve considered following that path again. More for my health and the benefit of the world than for ethical reasons. Somehow I’m able to compartmentalize my feelings about animals such that some are classified as food but the corporate, scorched earth approach to the manufacture of meat is hard to accept.

The first association makes me think of code and this class, how outside of my atmosphere I feel, and the second makes me wonder about the values we associate with things. Red velvet cake is just chocolate cake mix with red dye. But the words red and velvet are enough to shift our perception and change the way we experience the cake. Similarly, learning to code and diving into this program requires a shift of perception. This is, in fact, an atmosphere I can breathe."},"image":{"S":"image"},"video":{"S":"video"},"audio":{"S":"audio"}},{"dt":{"S":"Tue Oct 09 2018"},"time":{"S":"12:00pm"},"text":{"S":"text"},"image":{"S":"image"},"video":{"S":"video"},"audio":{"S":"audio"}},{"dt":{"S":"Tue Oct 30 2018"},"time":{"S":"(9:00am"},"text":{"S":"These tiny indents in my living room wall looks like the Big Dipper, which is coincidental because the final project for the Narrative and Dynamic Systems class I’m teaching is to research and design a divination system. My special guest for the class will be my friend Dalia Carella, who is a psychic, medium and tarot reader so stars and astrology have been on my mind. So, either my brain is prepped to see shapes related to astrology or the universe is telling me to focus on the project. It doesn't really matter, to me, which  explanation might be the truth because they both prompt similar self reflection. The ladle of the Big Dipper has an additional meaning for me at the moment. Because teaching, studying and freelance work I’ve had very little time to refill my creative well. Among all my responsibilities and commitments I need to find the time to take care of myself physically, emotionally and creatively. Thank you, Big Dipper, for the reminder."},"image":{"S":"image"},"video":{"S":"video"},"audio":{"S":"audio"}},{"dt":{"S":"Wed Nov 14 2018"},"time":{"S":"1:30pm"},"text":{"S":"A head of lettuce. I don’t remember when I first noticed size correlation of a head of lettuce and a human’s head but this always seems to imply some act of violence. I can’t help walking through the produce aisle without equating salads to decapitation. Surely I’m not alone in this. The curls and veiny folds suggest brainy matter and the delicate nature of our heads. This is also a reminder to eat healthier. I want to up my veggie intake significantly.

I love exploration and all of the accompanying peaks and valleys, the highs and lows, but I recognize I have a need to decompress and integrate what I’ve been learning, make it my own then share the results with the world.
